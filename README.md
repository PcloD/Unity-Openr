***IF YOU GET THE MESSAGE: ""[App name] canâ€™t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer", YOU'LL NEED TO CLICK THE APP WHILE PRESSING CTRL***

## Requirements

This project is using a third party script called **"appify"**, created by [mathiasbynens]. The script is already in the repository but you can download it at:  https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099


This script is going to compile your shell script into a .app application.

## Compile

**THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STEP, ONLY EXECUTE THIS IF YOU'D LIKE TO RECOMPILE THE APPLICATION**

Download the files in this repository. Navigate to it using the terminal. When you find the project root execute the command:

```sh
$ ./appify openunity.sh "Unity Openr"
```

In order to give your application permission, you are going to need to execute this command:

```sh
$ chmod 744 Unity\ Openr.app
```
